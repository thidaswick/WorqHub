# 🚀 WorkHub – Multi-Tenant MERN SaaS Platform

WorkHub is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** built using the **MERN stack** that enables SMEs to manage **work orders, inventory, customers, invoicing, and reports** within a single shared system while maintaining **strict tenant data isolation**.

The platform is designed to be **secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready**, supporting thousands of tenants on shared infrastructure with a clear upgrade path for enterprise clients.

## 🧠 System Architecture Overview

WorkHub follows a **layered backend architecture** to ensure maintainability and scalability:


### Layer Responsibilities
- **Routes** – API endpoints
- **Middlewares** – Authentication, authorization, tenant resolution
- **Controllers** – Request & response handling
- **Services** – Business workflow orchestration
- **Engines** – Core domain logic
- **Models** – Database schemas and access

---

## 🏢 Multi-Tenancy Design

- Shared MongoDB database
- Every document contains a mandatory `tenantId`
- Tenant resolution via:
  - Subdomain (e.g. `clientA.workhub.com`)
  - JWT token
- `tenantId` is injected server-side and never trusted from the client

✅ Prevents cross-tenant data leakage  
✅ Secure shared infrastructure model  

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Tokens include:
  - `userId`
  - `tenantId`
  - `role`
- Role-Based Access Control enforced at API level
- Secure middleware-based authorization

---

## 📦 Inventory & Financial Integrity

- All inventory changes recorded as **immutable transactions**
- No direct stock manipulation
- Invoices generated strictly from:
  - Inventory transactions
  - Labor/service entries
- Ensures auditability and prevents financial tampering

---

## ⚙️ Asynchronous Processing

Heavy operations are handled asynchronously using background job queues:

- Invoice PDF generation
- Email and notification sending
- Low inventory alerts
- Report aggregation

This keeps the user interface **fast and responsive**.
